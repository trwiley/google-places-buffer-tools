# Google Places Buffer Scraping

Sets of tools for perfoming scraping of Google Places data based on location. The idea behind this analysis is to scrape within the bounds of a defined geographic area such as a county through strategically placed points. These tools can be divided into two categories:

1) Those used for buffer visualization in ArcGIS Pro
2) Those used for the buffer scraping itself.
